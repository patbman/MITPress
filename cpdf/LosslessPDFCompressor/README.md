Functionality
---

The Coherent Lossless PDF Compressor performs rearrangements and optimisations
of the existing structure of a PDF file to reduce its size. Reductions range
from none to 80% in tests. The reduction depends on how the file was produced,
and what it contains. It works best on files with text and vector content,
rather than bitmap scans.

Unlike other PDF compressors, Lossless PDF Compressor:

* will not resample, reduce, or alter your images in any way
* will not prevent your PDF file from being edited afterward
* will not remove bookmarks, outlines, or other metadata

Lossless PDF Compressor preserves your document entirely, and conforms to the
Adobe/ISO specification for PDF.
