# MIT Press

In the summer of 2016 I had an internship at MIT Press in Cambridge, MA where i got to program a python script that would automate how the form their books.

the program takes the xml file provided for the book and examines it then adds the data it finds from the xml file to the books metadata then from there it merge the different pdf files that MIT press has with the book such as the cover, MIT's copyright page and the actual book
