PDF Merger and Metadata

at the moment only the single pdf option works the function to do with a config file is in the code but havent fully worked out all of it yet

COMMANDS:
-h = help
-i = input directory default input directory is input/
-o = output directory default output directory is output/
-C = cover file
-r = copyright file
-xml = xml file
-con = specify a .ini file to run 

EXAMPLES:
python pdfmer_metv2.py -i /path/to/input -o /path/to/output -C /path/to/cover -r /path/to/copyright -xml /path/to/xml

NOTES:
the script uses two python pdf libraries one is PyPDF2 and the other is pdfrw 

the pdfrw library does the merging of the different files 

the PyPDF2 library adds the metadata to the pdf that was made by pdfrw


a small thing is that while running the terminal will be outputting something that ends with cpdf.sh this can be ignored it is still doing what is is meant to do.
